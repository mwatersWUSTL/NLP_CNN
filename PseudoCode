1. Import necessary libraries and tools for data manipulation, ML, NLP, and deep learning.

2. Initialize a list of stopwords in English from the nltk library.

3. Generate code which will take EMR notes, and identify CTCAE toxicity terms and associated vectors using fuzzy match
    a. Generate a blurb using a window from a positively ID'ed term

4. Define a function to clean text:
    a. Remove punctuation.
    b. Convert text to lowercase.
    c. Remove contractions using a predefined dictionary.
    d. Remove stopwords.

5. Clean the Positively ID'ed Entity Window

6. Set hyperparameters for text preprocessing and CNN model:
    a. Vocabulary size, embedding dimensions, max length of sequences, type of truncation, padding type, OOV token, training data portion, etc.
    b. Hyperparameters specific to CNN model like the number of filters, kernel size, hidden dimensions, etc.

7. Split the dataset into training and validation sets:
    a. Use 80% of the data for training and 20% for validation, and stratify based on the 'Class' column.
    b. One-hot encode the target 'Class' column for training and validation.

8. Tokenize the text:
    a. Fit a tokenizer on the training blurbs.
    b. Convert training and validation blurbs to sequences.
    c. Pad sequences to a maximum length.

9. Define a CNN model:
    a. Add an embedding layer.
    b. Add a 1D convolutional layer.
    c. Use max-pooling.
    d. Add a dense hidden layer with a ReLU activation.
    e. Add dropout for regularization.
    f. Add a dense output layer with a softmax activation.
    g. Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and set accuracy as the metric.

10. Train the CNN model on the training data with a certain number of epochs (to be decided based on training time) and validate on 20% of the training data.

11. Plot training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

12. Evaluate the model on the validation set:
    a. Predict classes for validation set.
    b. Print a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.

13. Use the trained model to predict the class for a given text example:
    a. Tokenize and pad the given text.
    b. Predict class probabilities using the model.
    c. Print the predicted class.
